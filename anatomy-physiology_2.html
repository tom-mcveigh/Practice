			<h1>The Incredible Bottlenose Dolphin</h1>
			<h2 class="page-heading">Anatomy, Physiology and Senses of the Bottlenose Dolphin</h2>
			<h3>Anatomy</h3>
			<figure class="position"><img src="anatomy_2.jpg" alt="dophin head picture"><figcaption class="fig_caption">Bottlenose dolphin head, showing rostrum and blowhole</figure>
			<p>Their elongated upper and lower jaws form what is called a rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the blowhole on top of its head; the nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open.</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 28 conical teeth on each side of each jaw.</p>
			
			<p>The flukes (lobes of the tail) and dorsal fin are formed of dense connective tissue and do not contain bone or muscle. The dorsal fin usually shows phenotypic variations that help discriminate among populations. The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The pectoral flippers (at the sides of the body) are for steering; they contain bones homologous to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or "hind legs", at the tail, about the size of a human's pair of hands. Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of atavism.</p>
			
			<h3>Physiology</h3>
			<p>In colder waters, they have more body fat and blood, and are more suited to deeper diving. Typically, 18<abbr title="percent">%</abbr>â€“20<abbr title="percent">%</abbr> of their bodyweight is blubber. Most research in this area has been restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean. Bottlenose dolphins typically swim at 5 to 11 <abbr title="kiometers per hour">km/h</abbr> (1.4 to 3.1 <abbr title="meters per second">m/s</abbr>), but are capable of bursts of up to 29 to 35 <abbr title="kilometers per hour">km/h</abbr> (8.1 to 9.7 <abbr title="meters per second">m/s</abbr>). The higher speeds can only be sustained for a short time.</p>
			
			<h3>Senses</h3>
			
					
			<p id="senses">The dolphin's search for food is aided by a form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by producing sounds and listening for the echos. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an "echoic image" or sound picture of their targets.</p>
				
			
			<p>Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The eyes are located at the sides of the head and have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapetum_lucidum" title="tapetum lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a>, or reflecting membrane, at the back of the retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).</p>
			
			<p>By contrast, a bottlenose's sense of smell is poor, because its blowhole, the analogue to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but this has not been well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.</p>
			
			<h3>Communication</h3>
			<figure class="position"><img src="communication.jpg" alt="picture of dolphin with young"><figcaption id="fig_caption">Mother and juvenile bottlenose dolphins head to the seafloor</figure>
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins communicate through burst pulsed sounds, whistles, and body language. Examples of body language include leaping out of the water, snapping jaws, slapping the tail on the surface and butting heads. Sounds and gestures help keep track of other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).</p>
			
			<p>Researchers from the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (<a href="http://www.thebdri.com/" title="BDRI">BDRI</a>), based in Sardinia (Italy) have now shown whistles and burst pulsed sounds are vital to the animals' social life and mirror their behaviors.</p>
			
			<p>The tonal whistle sounds (the most melodious ones) allow dolphins to stay in contact with each other (above all, mothers and offspring), and to coordinate hunting strategies. The burst-pulsed sounds (which are more complex and varied than the whistles) are used "to avoid physical aggression in situations of high excitement", such as when they are competing for the same piece of food, for example. The dolphins emit these strident sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey. The "least dominant" one soon moves away to avoid confrontation.</p>
			
			<p>Other communication uses about 30 distinguishable sounds, and although famously proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Lilly" title"John Lilly">John Lilly</a> in the 1950s, no "dolphin language" has been found. However, Herman, Richards, and Wolz demonstrated comprehension of an artificial language by two bottlenose dolphins (named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akeakamai" title="Akeakamai">Akeakamai</a> and Phoenix) in the period of skepticism toward animal language following Herbert Terrace's critique.</p>
