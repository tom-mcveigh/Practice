			<h3>Description</h3>
			<figure id="taxonomy"><img src="taxonomy_2.jpg" alt="dolphin fossil picture"></figure>
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins are grey, varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside. This countershading makes them hard to see, both from above and below, when swimming. Adults range from 2 to 4 <abbr title="meters">meters</abbr> (6.6 to 13.1 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>), and 150 to 650 <abbr title="kilograms">kilograms</abbr> (330 to 1,430 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). Males are, on average, slightly longer and considerably heavier than females. In most parts of the world, the adults are about 2.5 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (8.2 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>), and 200 to 300 <abbr title="kiograms">kilograms</abbr> (440 to 660 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). Their size varies considerably with habitat. Except in the eastern Pacific, dolphins in warmer, shallower waters tend to be smaller than those in cooler, pelagic waters.</p>

			<p>Bottlenose dolphins can live for more than 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2<abbr title="percent">%</abbr> of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 <abbr title="meters">meters</abbr> (20 <abbr title="feet">feet</abbr>) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.</p>

			<h3>Taxonomy</h3>
			<p>Scientists were long aware that <i class="taxonomy">Tursiops</i> dolphins might consist of more than one species. Molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="IUCN">IUCN</a> acknowledges two species, although a third distinct species was described in 2011: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin" title="Common bottlenose dolphin">the common bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taxonomy">T. truncatus</i>) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans, and it has a grey color, with the shade of grey varying among populations, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin; the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (<i class="taxonomy">T. t. ponticus</i>), a subspecies of <i class="taxonomy">T. truncatus</i> lives in the Black Sea; The Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. gillii or T. t. gillii), another subspecies of T. truncatus, lives in the Pacific, and has a black line from the eye to the forehead; the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus) lives in the waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa, with the back being dark-grey and the belly being lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots; the Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, was described in September 2011 after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus, but is not considered a separate species by the IUCN.</p>	
				
				<p>The two ecotypes of the common bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, but they have been shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.</p>
				
				<p>Old scientific data do not distinguish between the two species, making it useless for determining structural differences between them. The IUCN lists both species as data deficient on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_List" title="Red List">Red List</a> of endangered species because of this issue.</p>
				
				<p>Some recent genetic evidence suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose belongs in the genus <i class="taxonomy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenella" title=Stenella>Stenella</a></i>, since it is more like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_spotted_dolphin" title="Atlantic spotted dolphin">Atlantic spotted dolphin</a> (<i class="taxonomy">Stenella frontalis</i>) than the common bottlenose.</p>

				<h3>Hybrids</h3>
				<p>Bottlenose dolphins have been known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risso%27s_dolphin" title="Risso's dolphin">Risso's dolphin</a> occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolphin" title="wolphin">wolphin</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_killer_whale" title="false killer whale">false killer whale</a>-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-toothed_dolphin" title="rough-toothed dolphin">rough-toothed dolphin</a> hybridized. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_dolphin" title="common dolphin">common dolphin</a>-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaWorld_San_Diego" title="SeaWorld">SeaWorld</a> California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.</p>
