			<h1>The Incredible Bottlenose Dolphin</h1>
			<h2>Intelligence of the Bottlenose Dolphin</h2>
			<h3>Cognition</h3>
			<p>Cognitive abilities that have been investigated include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s. This includes: Acoustic and behavioral mimicry, Comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language, Memory, Monitoring of self behavior, Discrimination and matching, Comprehension of symbols for various body parts, Comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), Mirror self-recognition, and Numerical values.</p>
			
			<h3>Tool use and Culture</h3>

			<p>At least some wild bottlenose dolphins use tools. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Bay" title="Shark Bay">Shark Bay</a>, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably to protect it when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).</p>
			
			<p>Mud plume feeding is a feeding technique performed by a small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud in the water column and then rushing through the plume to capture fish.</p>
			
			<p>Along the beaches and tidal marshes of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States, bottlenose dolphins cooperatively herd prey fish onto steep and sandy banks in a practice known as "strand feeding". Groups of between two and six dolphins are regularly observed creating a bow wave to force the fish out of the water. The dolphins follow the fish, stranding themselves briefly, to eat their prey before twisting their bodies back and forth in order to slide back into the water.</p>
			
			<p>Some Mauritanian dolphins cooperate with human fishermen. The dolphins drive a school of fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch a large number of fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of cetacean culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.</p>
			
			<p>Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three bottlenose dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they elevate the upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.</p>
			
			<p>A study conducted by the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they'd lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds. The new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than humans.</p>
			
			<h3>Cortical Neurons</h3>
			<p>Some researchers theorize mammalian intelligence correlates to the number of nerve cells (neurons) in the cortex of the brain. The neocortical neuron number of the bottlenose dolphin is unknown. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons#Cerebral_cortex" title="species with the highest number of neocortical neurons">species with the highest number of neocortical neurons</a> known to date is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-finned_pilot_whale" title="long-finned pilot whale">long-finned pilot whale</a>.</p>
