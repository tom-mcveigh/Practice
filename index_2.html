			<h1>The Incredible Bottlenose Dolphin</h1>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins, the genus <i class="taxonomy"><a href="description-taxonomy.html#taxonomy" title="tursiops">Tursiops</a></i>, are the most common members of the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphinidae" title="Delphinidae">Delphinidae</a>, the family of oceanic dolphin. Molecular studies show the genus contains three species: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin" title="common bottlenose dolphin">common bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops truncatus</i>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific_bottlenose_dolphin" title="Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin">Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops aduncus</i>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrunan_dolphin" title="Burrunan dolphin">Burrunan dolphin</a> (<i class="taximony">Tursiops australis</i>). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide, being found everywhere except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions.</p>

			<p>Bottlenose dolphins live in groups typically of 10â€“30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.</p>
			
			<p>Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television programs such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipper_(1964_TV_series)" title="Flipper (1964 TV series)">Flipper</a></i>. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.</p>
			
			<p>The deepest dive ever recorded for a bottlenose dolphin was 300 <abbr title="meters">meters</abbr> (990 <abbr title="feet">feet</abbr>). This was accomplished by Tuffy, a dolphin trained by the US Navy.</p>
			
			<p>Nellie, the longest-lived Atlantic bottlenose dolphin in human care, died at age 61 on <time datetime="2014-04-30">April 30th 2014</time>. Nellie was born on <time datetime="1953-02-27">Feb, 27, 1953</time> at Marineland.</p>
			
			<p>Bottlenose dolphins have the second largest encephalization levels of any mammal on Earth (humans have the largest), sharing close ratios with those of humans and other great apes, which more than likely contributes to their incredibly high intelligence and emotional intelligence.</p>
